# Java Basics

This repository contains example Java programs to demonstrate fundamental concepts in Java programming.

## Contents

1. **String Methods Example:**
   - Demonstrates various String methods such as `length()`, `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`, `substring()`, `concat()`, `indexOf()`, `replace()`, and `trim()`.

2. **String Array Sorting:**
   - Illustrates how to sort a String array using the `Arrays.sort()` method.

3. **Float Input Program:**
   - Takes a float input from the user and performs calculations like squaring, cubing, and calculating the square root.

4. **While Loop Program:**
   - Utilizes a `while` loop to repeatedly take positive integer inputs from the user until a negative number is entered.

5. **Do-While Loop Program:**
   - Implements a `do-while` loop to repeatedly take positive integer inputs from the user until a negative number is entered.

6. **For Loop Triangle Program:**
   - Uses a `for` loop to print a triangle of numbers, where each row has an increasing number of elements.

7. **2D Integer Array Program:**
   - Implements a 2D integer array with different numbers of columns in different rows.

8. **3D Integer Array Program:**
   - Demonstrates a 3D integer array with multiple levels of nested arrays.
