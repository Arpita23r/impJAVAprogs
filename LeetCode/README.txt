1. Introduction:

This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems focused on data structures and algorithms. I use it to practice and document my solutions while honing my problem-solving skills.

2. Problem Categories:

LeetCode problems cover a wide range of topics related to data structures and algorithms. The solutions in this repository are organized into various categories, including:
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees and Graphs
- Sorting and Searching
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- and more...

You can navigate to each category's folder to find solutions and related code.

3. Solving Approach:

For each problem, I aim to provide clear and efficient solutions. The code is well-documented with comments to explain the thought process and logic behind the solution. I also include explanations and analysis of time and space complexity when necessary.

4. File Naming Convention:

The files in this repository follow a specific naming convention: `problem_name.extension`, where:
- `problem_name` is a brief and descriptive name of the problem.
- `extension` is the programming language extension (e.g., `.cpp` for C++, `.java` for Java, `.py` for Python).

5. Contributing:

Contributions are encouraged! If you have a better solution, found a bug, or want to add a new problem solution, please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/new-solution`.
3. Make your changes and thoroughly test them.
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add new solution for problem_name"`.
5. Push to your branch: `git push origin feature/new-solution`.
6. Create a Pull Request (PR) with a clear description of your changes.
